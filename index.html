<FONT Size="2">claussen.org was registered to provide e-mail addresses to my immediate family.  
This goes against the values which built the Internet.  If you share the Claussen name you are 
welcome to an @claussen.org alias.  Please note I am only able to provide aliases, due to 
resource limitations.  I do not tolarate SPAM or other nasty things.  Anyone doing so with an 
@claussen.org alias will have their alias terminated immediately with no discussion. <BR><BR>  With
that out of the way...  :)  To request an alias, please send an e-mail to aliasspam@claussen.org.  
 Remove the word spam from the e-mail address before sending.  Keep in mind that I may request
  proof of family name.

** update (04/18/02):  The address aliasspam@claussen.org is not valid, my mail server throws them away.  If you read the message above, you will easily learn what the vaild e-mail address is.  This is done as a spam prevention measure.
